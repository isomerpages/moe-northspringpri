<h1>General information for Parents</h1>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring your Child’s Health</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Do check if your child/ward is well before he/she leaves for school on
a daily basis. If they show symptoms of physically unwell, please take
him/her to the doctor and allow him/her to rest at home for the full duration
indicated in the Medical Certificate (MC) and recover fully before returning
to school.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Absence from School</strong>&nbsp;
<br>If a student is absent from school, he/she must provide a MC or letter
signed by parents explaining the reason for the child’s absence from school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents are strongly discouraged to take their children out of school
for vacation or family functions during school term. Students must learn
the habit of commitment, diligence and importance of being present in school
during term time.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Student’s Absence on Assessment/Examination Days</strong>&nbsp;
<br>If a student has fever or looks unwell, he/she will not be allowed to
take the assessments/exams. Parents will be contacted to take him/her home.
Everyone plays an important part to stay away from crowds when unwell to
avoid the spread of sickness.</p>
<p>If a student is absent from any assessment/exams, he/she must produce
a valid MC upon return to the school. TCM MCs and parents’ letters are
not valid for exam purposes. Students will be given a zero grade if no
valid MCs are provided for his/her absence. The school will not have a
make-up or reschedule the dates of Written or Listening Comprehension assessments/examinations.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Leaving the School before Dismissal</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Students are not allowed to leave the school before dismissal. If parents
are picking up their child/ward who is unwell or needs to leave school
before dismissal time, they are required to fill in and submit the Early
Departure Form at the General Office. This will ensure safety of the child
and that he/she leaves with his/her parent or an authorised adult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any planned early dismissal, advance notice must be given either by
phone or written note to the respective Form Teachers.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Visits to the School</strong>&nbsp;
<br>All parents or guardians are to obtain visitors’ passes from the school
security guards at the main gate before they proceed to the General Office
for assistance. Parents/Guardians are not allowed to walk up directly to
their child’s/ward’s classrooms.</p>
<p>If parents would like to speak with the Form/Subject teachers, prior appointments
must be made at least 1 day before the actual visit as teachers may have
to attend meetings/ workshops on that day. Teachers will not be able to
meet parents during their teaching periods. Alternatively, parents can
communicate with teachers via phone or email.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>School Canteen</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Parents and other visitors are not allowed to patronise the school canteen
stalls. This is to ensure that there is sufficient food prepared for staff
and students on school days.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Road Safety</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Parents are only allowed to drive into the school compound to drop their
child/ward on rainy days. Do co-operate with the traffic marshals to ensure
an overall safe and smooth traffic flow. Please drop your child/ward only
at the designated drop off points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not sound the horn within the school compound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educate your child how to alight from the vehicle as quickly as possible
so as not to delay the other drivers. Please assist in doing your farewells
at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you and your child are cycling to school, do dismount the bicycle so
as not to hit any pedestrians who are walking through the gates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school reserves the right to stop any errant drivers from entering
the school compound as the staff and students’ safety are very important
to us.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Working Together</strong>
<br>The school practices a policy on “Working Together”. Both parents and
teachers have the same intention to educate the child at the centre; both
academic and character education. Do speak to the teacher if you have any
concerns to better understand both sides before arriving at any conclusion.
Parents must trust and work with the school to help every student.</p>
<p>In North Spring, we want to partner the parents so as to work in the best
interest of our students. We hope you will show the same respect and treat
each North Spring staff with dignity.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Use of Photographs/Videos</strong>
<br>Photographs(s) or video image(s) of students and parents may be captured
during school activities and events such as classroom lessons, CCAs, school
camps and school programmes. The school may use and publish such photographs
and /or video recordings in school publications, websites, social media
channels and other communication channels.</p>
