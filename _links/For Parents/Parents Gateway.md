**What is Parents Gateway?**
----------------------------

The Parents Gateway (PG) is a portal developed by the Ministry of Education and GovTech, that brings the educational partnership between parents and school closer. With the PG app, parents will get to stay updated with school announcements, activities and consent forms.

  

North Spring Primary School is implementing the usage of the app progressively starting in Term 2. Parents who have children studying in other schools can use the same app to monitor them.

  

The School would like to encourage parents to download and use the app. For more information, please do visit [https://pg.moe.edu.sg/](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)
