Principal’s Message
===================

It is my great pleasure to welcome you to North Spring Primary School.

_We believe in the philosophy of holistic education where our students are placed at the heart of the learning process. It is our mission to_&nbsp;BUILD CHARACTER, NURTURE MINDS and STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE. We are committed to develop and nurture our students to be CONFIDENT, CULTURED and ASPIRED LEARNERS so that they can navigate an increasingly challenging and complex environment.

_We believe every student wants to succeed._&nbsp;Everyone has a dream and an aspiration. Only when they dare to dream will their dreams really come true. Students are&nbsp;guided by our staff to define success, uncover their talents, learn about their strengths and strengthen their areas of growths to achieve success in their lives. Students learn to set goals, are encouraged to do their best, learn something new each day and to always celebrate small victories every step of the way. When our students adopt such an outlook, they are one step closer to their dreams and aspirations.&nbsp;And to aptly quote our first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “I say look at that horizon, follow that rainbow, go ride it.”

_We value every student._&nbsp;We offer exciting and enriching activities each month for students to look forward to in school. Pictures speak a thousand words. Visit our Facebook and Instagram to view our marvellous programmes and activities in North Spring Primary School.

_We believe every student is a G.E.M._&nbsp;Our teachers are committed to GROW, EMPOWER AND MOTIVATE our students. Through an array of values and character development programmes, the school emphasises on our staff and students to uphold the school values; INTEGRITY, RESPONSIBILITY, RESILIENCE and COMPASSION. Values are not only taught during formal, structured lessons but are also caught through hands-on programmes such as SHINE, CAN! and student leadership programmes. Students believe in themselves more, overcome their fears and understand that they have control over their destiny.

_North Spring Primary School is our second home where we shine like GEMS._&nbsp;The Gracious Movement aims to shape our students to have good character and a strong mind. Each week, students reflect on their actions and the people around them. Over the year, students show and express their appreciation to self and others. We are proud and heartened to see our students being more aware of the contributors in their daily lives through these events and activities.

_All of them can learn._&nbsp;North Spring Primary School has a vibrant school community that supports the development and learning of our students. We want to continually cultivate the growth mindset so that our students become resilient and can face challenges bravely. Beyond the formal curriculum, our&nbsp;**Applied Learning Programme**&nbsp;– Sustainability, provides students the opportunity to acquire design thinking maker’s approach problem solving skills. Our&nbsp;**Learning for Life Programme**&nbsp;\- Play Your Hearts Out! instils in our students an appreciation for sports and outdoor education. A series of&nbsp;**JOY of Learning (JoL) experiences**&nbsp;are also planned and carried out throughout the year. One of them is our REALLY FUN Day in which students in different levels visit different places in Singapore on Children’s Day ([https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1131930777762046](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1131930777762046)).

_We are energised by supportive and understanding parents._&nbsp;We are grateful to receive the support of our Parent Support Group. Besides ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our students, our parents are involved in promoting the school’s values and building the characters of North Springers.

We step into 2023 with fervour steered by our mission to engage our students in active learning for them to embody growth mindset, self-discipline and hard work to ultimately achieve and surpass their potentials.
