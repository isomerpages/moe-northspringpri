<p><strong><u>NORTH SPRING PRIMARY SCHOOL ASSESSMENT POLICY</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>PHILOSOPHY</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our assessment policy seeks to be aligned with MOE’s assessment philosophy
to achieve a more balanced assessment system and to develop a common understanding
among stakeholders regarding standards and expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A learner-centred and balanced school assessment system provides school
leaders, key personnel, teachers, students, and parents with information
on the learning, development, and progress of students. It guides action
on how learning can be improved. Learning flourishes when assessment is
used to address learning gaps. Assessment must thus be continuous and designmeet
the needs of learners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>PRINCIPLES OF ASSESSMENT&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our below principles of assessment are aligned with the Singapore Teaching
Practice (STP) model:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment is integral to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment must be aligned with the intended learning
outcomes, content, and pedagogy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment facilitates meaningful learning through
learner-centricity with a formative effect on students’ learning.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assessment system must be balanced, integrating
Assessment for Learning (AfL) and Assessment of Learning (AoL), and used
for the right purpose (e.g., instructional use vs. accountability).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment information must be collected regularly
to evaluate current school practices and effect improvements in teaching
and learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ASSESSMENT IN NORTH SPRING PRIMARY SCHOOL</u></strong>
</p>
<p>North Spring nurtures students to be self-directed and effective lifelong
learners, striving for excellence in every endeavour. We aim for North
Springers to experience the joy of learning to effect strong intrinsic
motivation in learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have moved away from an over-emphasis on academic results and refined
our school-based assessment structures. Time and space have been freed
up to better pace teaching and learning, adopt effective pedagogies to
deepen our students’ learning, encourage self-directed learning and strengthen
holistic development. These facilitate student-centred teaching and learning
approaches and nurture lifelong learning attitudes and skills in North
Springers. Bite-sized assessments (for P1 and P2) and termly (weighted)
assessments (for P3 to P6) are conducted to gauge the learning progress
of our students. The performance of assessments informs all stakeholders
about students’ readiness for promotion to the next level/course of study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessments in North Spring include:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formative Assessment: Regular classroom assessments
for learning, including quizzes, class participation, project work, and
oral presentations.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summative (Weighted and End of Year (EOY)) Assessment:
End-of-term examinations, standardized tests, and other assessments of
learning to measure students' understanding of the curriculum.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holistic Assessment: Observations, student reflections,
and peer assessments to support the development of values, attitudes, and
life skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>COMPUTATION OF WEIGHTED AND EOY ASSESSMENT MARKS (P3 TO P5)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Term 2 and Term 3 Weighted Assessments
(WA): 15% each</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End of Year (EOY) Examination: 70%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weighted and EOY assessment marks will be shared through the report
book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ROLE OF LEARNERS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students must take ownership of their learning and put in effort to understand
how they can improve. Students must:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be involved in self and peer assessment as part of
learning to be self-directed learners;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflect and learn from their mistakes; and</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work towards attaining the next level of achievement
based on feedback received from teachers, peers, and parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>F.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ROLE OF TEACHERS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers help learners become assessors and motivate students to achieve
learning success. They:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strengthen communication of standards with students
to enhance students’ competencies in student-involved assessment for productive
learning;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide different forms of feedback to target students’
learning needs and gaps correctly;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bolster the implementation of self-assessment interventions;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; design appropriate assessment as part of effective
teaching and learning to enable students to experience academic success
and build confidence; and</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leverage student-involved assessment to engage and
motivate students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>G.&nbsp; <u>PARENTAL SUPPORT</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students succeed best when parents collaborate with schools to support
them. Parents should:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have regular conversations with their child to understand
the child’s progress in school;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make use of the various feedback given by teachers
in assignments, tests, and exams and from conversations with teachers to
guide the child in his or her development;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide a conducive home environment for the child
to learn;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guide the child in developing the right skill sets
to succeed, for example, in time management, good sleeping and eating habits,
and most importantly, how to learn from mistakes; and</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not complete students’ work for them, as this will
increase reliance and hamper their self-directedness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>H.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ROLE OF SCHOOL LEADERS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>School Leaders:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shape the assessment philosophy and establish policies</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foster a positive culture around assessments aligned
with educational standards.</p>
<p>Oversee assessment quality, review data regularly, and implement feedback
loops for continuous improvemen</p>
