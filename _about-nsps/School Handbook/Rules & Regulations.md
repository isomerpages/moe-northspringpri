<h1><strong>School Rules</strong></h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Punctuality</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punctuality is a habit that must be instilled
from young.&nbsp; Students must be in school during term time unless they
are unwell.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be punctual for school
and for all school functions. Students are to assemble in school by 7.25
a.m. at the respective assembly areas. Flag raising will be conducted at
7.30 a.m. sharp.&nbsp; Any student who arrives later than 7.30 a.m. in
classroom or school hall will be considered late.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a student is late more than 3 times
per term, he/she will be issued an advisory letter.&nbsp; <u>The Conduct Grade will be affected for those who are constantly late</u> and
student management action will be taken against these students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are <u>not allowed</u> to leave
the school compound during curriculum hours without permission. This includes
those who are attending after-school activities in the afternoon (e.g.
CCA, Enrichment, Remedial, Supplementary, LSP) and are not allowed to leave
the school premise until such activities have ended. Parents are required
to <u>pick up their child personally</u> during school hours from the General
Office if there is any immediate family emergency to attend to.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regular attendance is essential in
achieving effective teaching and learning, the opportunity for learning
and growth is lost when the students do not attend school regularly or
are late for school.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure students’ presence in school
is consistent for learning, the school will keep track of students with
a prevalent VR (private) record and work closely with parents / guardians
to support the student for regular attendance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Attire and Appearance</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student must understand the purpose
of rules in instilling discipline and maintaining safety in the school.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be uniformity in appearance
when students come to school<strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>(Please refer
to photos for examples of school attire). <u>Students who request to wear long track pants due to medical reasons must first seek approval from the school every year</u>.
A formal request, accompanied by relevant medical documentation, should
be submitted to the school leaders for consideration. Approval will be
granted on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students’ attire must be neat and tidy.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls with long hair (longer than the
collar) must have it tied neatly in a ponytail or in plaits.&nbsp; Long
fringe must be pulled back with a hair band or hair clip.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls are not allowed to wear make-up
including lining their eyes with eyeliner or kohl.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boys must have short and acceptable hairstyles.&nbsp;
Boys are not allowed to shave closely to the scalp on one side and have
longer fringe on the other side.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hair at the back must be sloped and should
not touch the school uniform collar.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Males being clean shaven e.g. All male students must be clean shaven at all times. Moustache and beards are not allowed. &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Disciplinary action will be taken against students who continuously
break the rules despite counselling and reminders sent. Parents / Guardians
are to ensure that the student appears with acceptable hairstyle during
term time for uniformity.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Spot check will be conducted and students are given up to 3
days to rectify and comply with standards.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>School Safety</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school must be a safe place
for everyone.&nbsp; <strong>Students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon.&nbsp; They are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is intended to be used to cause harm to others.</strong> Action
will be taken against students who possess such weapons.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized use of electronic,
communication, entertainment, or gaming devices that can capture, store,
display, or transmit information will result in the device being kept by
the school and returned only to the student’s parent or guardian. Examples
include mobile phones, cameras, tablets and smartwatches.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic devices may be used
only after dismissal or outside school hours and <strong><u>must remain switched off during school</u></strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school will not conduct searches
for lost or missing personal items. Students are expected to safeguard
their personal belongings and should avoid displaying them openly.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>When teachers permit device use for learning, students must act responsibly and follow the school’s zero-bullying and cyber safety rules. Taking photos, videos, recordings of others or posting them online without permission is prohibited. The school may retain the device for disciplinary or investigative purposes.</u>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every North Springer will adhere
to the school vision to be <strong>Confident, Cultured and Aspiring Learners</strong>.
Students are to learn good habits and always exercise the right values.
They must demonstrate respect to themselves, their peers, teachers and
school property.&nbsp; The school advocates <strong>Grow, Empower and Motivate (GEM)</strong> to
students at all times.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a school community, we will
exercise care, support and respect for one another.&nbsp; There is <strong>Zero Tolerance </strong>for
bullying at NSPS.&nbsp; Bullying includes physical, psychological and cyber
bullying. The school will mediate and counsel students involved in bullying.&nbsp;
The school will take serious actions against students who repeatedly hurt
others despite counselling, mediation and warning.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school has a student management
process in place and students who do not adhere to school rules will be
meted with the appropriate consequences.&nbsp; Parents are requested to
work closely with the school so that we educate every student to take responsibility
for their own actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Nurturing Minds</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students must participate in
the flag-raising and pledge taking ceremony at the start of every school
day.&nbsp; <strong>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with their right fist over the heart</strong>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to show respect to the
nation, non-Singapore citizens must stand at attention and remain respectful
during the singing of the National Anthem and the recitation of the Pledge.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For every child to find meaning
in his/her learning, he/she must be ardent about learning. He/she must
be proud to be a North Springer and be ardent on learning the academics,
values and social emotional competencies.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be committed to their
holistic learning.&nbsp; The process of learning is as important as the
product.&nbsp; Hence, every student must complete all homework, worksheets
and corrections assigned by the teacher dutifully and handed in on time.&nbsp;
They must use the <strong>GEMbeats</strong> to manage their assignments and
time well.&nbsp; Parents are to help monitor that their child is completing
all work assigned on time.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must learn the habit of
organising their daily work so that everything is in order for their revision
purpose.&nbsp; All worksheets must be neatly filed in the respective subject
files and handed to the teacher for checking when required to.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remedial lessons will only be catered
to students who really need the assistance for closer coaching. Parents
are to ensure that their child attends the remedial lessons if they have
been selected for them.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are encouraged to act
responsibly by taking ownership in packing their bags every day and bringing
the necessary books/materials to school. Parents/domestic helpers are discouraged
from delivering any items to students during school hours to allow them
the opportunity to learn and be more responsible. Such acts also cause
disruption and additional work for office staff and the school reserves
the right to not accede to such requests.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must exercise <strong>integrity </strong>during
all tests/examinations. Students are considered to have cheated tests/examinations
when they are found:&nbsp;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copying &nbsp;from another
student or allowing another student to copy via various forms of communication
that include verbal/non-verbal gestures, display of writing materials;
retrieving information by any electronic means that include computerised
wrist watches, mobile phones, digital cameras etc.&nbsp; (list is not exhaustive)</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attempting to amend marks
or change answers on marked exam scripts.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any student who has cheated or
attempted to cheat, or collaborated with others with the intention to cheat,
will have to go through School Exam Committee’s investigations.&nbsp; If
found guilty, appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken against students
involved. The school’s decision shall be final.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Academic and CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school provides a holistic
development programme for our students.&nbsp; Every North Springer will
be confident and self-directed in his/her learning.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of every co-curricular
programme, students will be required to perform / share their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be in the form of performance,
oral/written presentation, publication or reflection.&nbsp; This is aligned
to the school’s approach in developing confidence and commitment in every
student.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All P3 – P6 must attend every Modular
CCA session unless a valid written reason is provided and permission is
sought from the CCA teacher.&nbsp; For students who are selected for SPARK
CCAs, they must maintain 75% attendance or they may be dropped from the
respective CCAs.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student will be provided
opportunities and skills to be a leader.&nbsp; Leadership opportunities
will be provided in a tiered approach.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must adopt an excellence
mind-set and do the best that they can.&nbsp; They must challenge themselves
to realise their potential.&nbsp; Every student must set academic and character
goals every year to work towards their individual purpose. They will be
closely monitored and coached throughout the year so that they can reach
their optimal best.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>School Rules and Consequences</strong>
</p>
<p>The school believes that good discipline is an important contributing
factor towards creating an effective student-centric school. Our student
management policies and procedures foster self-discipline and desired behaviours
that are aligned to the school values. The following consequences serve
as a guide and depending on the severity of the offences, appropriate student
management action/s will be meted out in consultation with the School Leaders
and Key Personnel in-charge of student management matters.</p>
<p>If students violate the school rules and need to be disciplined, the school
seeks the understanding of parents and guardians to support the Student
Development Team (SDT) when student management actions are administered.</p>
