Homework Policy
===============

#### Objectives and Value Of Homework
Homework enables students to practise the skills taught and process the information learnt, resulting in better understanding and retention of learning. Through homework assignments, students have the opportunity to learn outside the classroom and nurture greater self-discipline, time management and self-directed learning. In the process, students cultivate good study habits and positive work ethics. Homework also provides parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and the opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning.

#### Role of Students
In order to benefit maximally from the value of homework, students should do the following on a daily basis.

* Refer to the whiteboard in the classroom for the homework assignments.
* Record the homework assignments in the **Student Handbook**.
* Make sure that they understand what needs to be done for all the given homework assignments.
* Do not be afraid to seek help from classmates, friends or teachers if they face any difficulty.
* Organize their textbooks, workbooks, worksheets and files systematically.
* Ensure that the homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.
* Have a home study timetable.
* Have a neat study area at home, which is away from distractions such as the television and the computer.

#### Role of Parents
Parents play an important part in the children’s education. Parents can consider doing the following to support their children in their learning.

* Check the child’s Student Handbook daily to view the homework assignments for the day.
* Spend time going through your child’s school work.
* Spend time supervising your child in doing the homework assignments and learning through the homework assignments.
* Remind your child to complete the school homework.
* Do not do the work for your child, as you would want your child to learn.
* Guide your child to set aside a regular study time and establish good study habits.
* Work in partnership with teachers and consult teachers on your child’s progress.

#### Role of Teachers
In order to benefit the pupils in their learning, teachers will

* design appropriate and meaningful homework;
* **set realistic** deadlines for submission of homework;
* establish and communicate clear expectations to students on the purpose and procedure of homework;
* coordinate with other teachers of the class on the frequency and quantity of homework to be given;
* check homework and provide timely feedback to students;
* provide timely intervention and support to students; and
* engage parents on homework matters and provide them with information pertaining to students’ learning progress.

#### MANAGEMENT OF STUDENTS’ LATE SUBMISSION OF HOMEWORK
Students are responsible for their own learning which include work submission. Late submission without valid reason is unacceptable as it disrupts the flow of learning for the student and the flow of lessons for the class.

When a student does not complete his/her homework/corrections by the deadline given by teachers, the student is considered late in submission.

1\. Teachers will ascertain the reason for the late submission.<br>
a. If there are valid reasons for the late submission (e.g. sickness, unexpected incidents at home), a new deadline will be worked out with the student with support provided to the student, if required (e.g. consultation after school).<br>
b. If there are no valid reasons for the late submission, the teacher will reinforce the above key messages, extend the deadline based on professional judgement (e.g. 2 days) and commit the student to the new deadline.

2\. In the case of 1b, if the student does not meet the extended deadline, the teacher will contact and inform you of the situation with the reason that the student cited for late submission of work despite being given an extended deadline. The **late assignment without valid reasons will not be marked** and will be labelled as ‘**late**’.

3\. For students who do not submit/ submit their work late frequently, they will be referred to the School Discipline Committee.

#### General Guidelines on Daily Homework
The school seeks to ensure pupils’ wellness by not overloading pupils with homework assignments. It adopts the following guidelines to manage the workload of pupils.

1\. The school and teachers have worked out an estimated amount of time that pupils would spend to complete their homework assignments daily.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| Level | EstimatedTime spent on Daily Homework (Mon – Fri) |
| Pr 1 & 2 | 1 hour  (20 mins assignment per subject) |
| Pr 3 & 4 | 1.5 hours (20 mins assignment per subject) |
| Pr 5 & 6 | 2 hours (30 mins assignment per subject) |
|

2\. In addition, pupils who are not able to finish the work set in class will also need to complete it at home but it will not be included in the estimated time.

3\. **Spelling for different subjects will be conducted on the following days:**<br>
English – Tuesday (All Levels)<br>
MT – Wednesday (All levels)<br>
Math (P1 to P3) – Friday<br>
Science (P3 – P6) – dependent on timetable<br>
If there is a public or school holiday, spelling will be postponed to the next school day.

4\. To allow students to take a break from formal learning and enjoy bonding time with their families, homework assignments will not be given during school holidays and festive holidays ie. Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali. A spelling activity or a test will also not be conducted on the school day after the festive period.

#### Partnership with Parents
The school believes in the value of homework to help students consolidate their knowledge and skills and cultivate lifelong habits of independent and self-directed learning. We seek the understanding, support and collaboration of parents as our partners in education to ensure that homework works for their children.
