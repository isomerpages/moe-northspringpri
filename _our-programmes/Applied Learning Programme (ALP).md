**TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH**

Sustainability is the heart of the Applied Learning Programme in NSPS. In NSPS, North Springers have the Maker’s Sustainability (M.A.S.S.) Education Programme where they adopt the design thinking maker’s approach to innovate and create solutions to contribute to a sustainable future for Mother Earth.   The modified design thinking approach shown below fosters a culture of empathy, resilience, and innovation, and is a process which seeks to develop values and skills not only towards the care of the environment, but towards all areas in life.

**Learning Experiences and Activities**

M.A.S.S. Education leverages on three platforms:

1.  Whole-school events and programmes
2.  Curriculum subject activities
3.  Tier 2 Science Explorers CCA Club advocates and Science Champions

<u>Whole- school events and programmes</u>

**Events**

Term 1: World Water Day featuring plastic pollution / climate change

World Water Day is an annual United Nations observance day that highlights the importance of fresh water. The day is used to advocate for the sustainable management of freshwater resources. In NSPS, we celebrate with learning about climate change and plastic pollution from guest speakers from TERRA SG and local book author Hwee Goh giving assembly talks about climate change and plastic pollution. There were also fun classroom and recess activities / competitions to allow North Springers to learn by playing !

Term 2: Earth Day commemorated during Math-Science week

Earth Day is an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection. In NSPS, we celebrate Earth Day during Math-Science week. North Springers are exposed to assembly, class and recess activities which helps them to apply both math and science knowledge and skills to solve problems.

Term 3: Youth for environment week

The focus of this event is centered around mobilizing North Springers for climate action. During this event, canteen stall owners contribute food waste and students use this food waste to make eco-enzymes. These eco-enzymes are eventually used as eco-cleansers for wipe-down. Food waste was also made into compost using food digesters.

**Save our Waste (S.O.W.) Programme**

Save Our Waste (S.O.W.) Programme is a school-wide programme where both staff and students adopt a hands-on approach to contribute to a sustainable future.

Part 1: Recycling paper and plastic waste

Starting from Term 1, in conjunction with the National Environment Agency’s campaign to Recycle Right, recycling bins for paper and plastic waste were made available for every class. Student leaders, class monitors and science champions, monitor the amount of paper and plastic waste collected by their classes and bring them to the canteen to weigh in the amount collected. These weigh-ins from the classes contribute to the total amount recycled by the school per month. Monthly updates of the amount of paper and plastics waste collected is done before flag-raising ceremony, where recycling facts are also shared with the school.

Due to our recycling efforts, NSPS has been featured on the NEA Recycle Right Facebook page

Part 2: Recycling food waste

NSPS embarked on food waste recycling during Math-Science week. Composters were placed in the canteen next to the plate collection area. Science Champions and Science Explorer CCA Club members were stationed at the food composters during recess to advocate for food waste recycling. North Springers and canteen vendors disposed of their food waste into the composters. The composters then processed the food waste to produce plant compost in a few hours. These compost is used as fertilizers to grow edible plants in pots arranged in the N-S-P-S form; proof that NSPS is pledging to do our part for the environment. As one of the Math-Science week recess booth activities, North Springers were challenged to guess the amount of compost required to fill all the pots needed to form the letters N-S-P-S.

With sufficient compost, the Science Explorer CCA Club members will proceed to grow the edible vegetables
