**TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH**

Sustainability is the heart of the Applied Learning Programme in NSPS. In NSPS, North Springers have the Maker’s Sustainability (M.A.S.S.) Education Programme where they adopt the design thinking maker’s approach to innovate and create solutions to contribute to a sustainable future for Mother Earth.   The modified design thinking approach shown below fosters a culture of empathy, resilience, and innovation, and is a process which seeks to develop values and skills not only towards the care of the environment, but towards all areas in life.

**Learning Experiences and Activities**

M.A.S.S. Education leverages on three platforms:

1.  Whole-school events and programmes
2.  Curriculum subject activities
3.  Tier 2 Science Explorers CCA Club advocates and Science Champions

<u>Whole- school events and programmes</u>

**Events**

Term 1: World Water Day featuring plastic pollution / climate change

World Water Day is an annual United Nations observance day that highlights the importance of fresh water. The day is used to advocate for the sustainable management of freshwater resources. In NSPS, we celebrate with learning about climate change and plastic pollution from guest speakers from TERRA SG and local book author Hwee Goh giving assembly talks about climate change and plastic pollution. There were also fun classroom and recess activities / competitions to allow North Springers to learn by playing !

Term 2: Earth Day commemorated during Math-Science week

Earth Day is an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection. In NSPS, we celebrate Earth Day during Math-Science week. North Springers are exposed to assembly, class and recess activities which helps them to apply both math and science knowledge and skills to solve problems.

Term 3: Youth for environment week

The focus of this event is centered around mobilizing North Springers for climate action. During this event, canteen stall owners contribute food waste and students use this food waste to make eco-enzymes. These eco-enzymes are eventually used as eco-cleansers for wipe-down. Food waste was also made into compost using food digesters.
