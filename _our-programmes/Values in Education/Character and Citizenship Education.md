Character and Citizenship Education
===================================
#### Guiding Idea
North Spring Primary School hopes to build a dynamic CCE curriculum that focuses on inculcating values, building character, developing life skills and a sense of belonging in our students. This is achieved through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, CCE Mother Tongue lessons, Social Studies lessons, school based initiatives (e.g. Gracious Movement, CAN!) as well as reinforced through key student development experiences comprising Programme for Active Learning (PAL), Co-curricular (CCA), NE Commemorative Days, Values in Action, Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort Camps, Student Leadership Development Programmes and Cohort Learning Journeys.

With the refreshed CCE 2021 curriculum, we aim to develop students who:<br>
(a) are resilient with a sound moral compass<br>
(b) have a good balance of social-emotional well-being<br>
(c) are active citizens that are ready for the future

#### National Education-Social Studies (NE-SS) Curriculum
The NE-SS curriculum aims to develop students to be concerned citizens and active contributors of our nation. Through our SS curriculum and commemorative events, students will learn to appreciate our past, adapt to our present and anticipate our future. To further enhance their experience and deepen their knowledge, students will:

*   utilise mobile devices to learn the subject in an interactive way.
*   travel out of school to places of interest and learn about multicultural Singapore and its heritages.
*   dive deep into the past and find out more about Singapore's history through historical trails.

These will help them understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in. By doing so, we will help students foster a national identity where they stay rooted with a global outlook.

<u>Experiences at the CCE Corner</u><br>
To complement the SS curriculum, students use technology and interact with artefacts at the CCE corner to deepen their learning experiences.
