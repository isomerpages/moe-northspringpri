Character and Citizenship Education
===================================
#### Guiding Idea
North Spring Primary School hopes to build a dynamic CCE curriculum that focuses on inculcating values, building character, developing life skills and a sense of belonging in our students. This is achieved through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, CCE Mother Tongue lessons, Social Studies lessons, school based initiatives (e.g. Gracious Movement, CAN!) as well as reinforced through key student development experiences comprising Programme for Active Learning (PAL), Co-curricular (CCA), NE Commemorative Days, Values in Action, Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort Camps, Student Leadership Development Programmes and Cohort Learning Journeys.

With the refreshed CCE 2021 curriculum, we aim to develop students who:<br>
(a) are resilient with a sound moral compass<br>
(b) have a good balance of social-emotional well-being<br>
(c) are active citizens that are ready for the future
