**Music Playground**

  

To make the school a vibrant environment for learning, we started the Music Challenge where students bond over different challenges every term held at our Music Playground. Students get to engage in fun and interactive games using the PS4 console. We had the Dance Off, Sing Off and Drum Off in Terms 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
