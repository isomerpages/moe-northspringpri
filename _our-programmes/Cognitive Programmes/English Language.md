TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH
------------------------------

The school hopes to build a strong foundation in the English Language among our students while cultivating their love for the language. Through the EL curriculum, language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) as well as knowledge about the language (grammar and vocabulary) are taught using effective and engaging strategies which are developmentally appropriate. To ignite the joy of language learning, various Language Experiences, Activities and Play (LEAP) are planned across the different levels.

Language Experiences
--------------------

Through experiential learning, students are able to connect to a learning topic on a personal level and experience it for themselves. Different language experiences are incorporated into the EL curriculum to provide students with the context and content for them to think, talk and write about.
