Festive Celebrations
--------------------

Together as a school, celebrating the 3 major festivals – Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali, allows our students to appreciate the multi-cultures that Singapore has and promote harmony and understanding between the different races.

Parents – Our Partners
----------------------

Our teachers engage our parents with workshops annually. Each year, we will organize workshop for parents so as to provide them with better understanding of the Mother Tongue Languages curriculum and assessment. In recent years, due to the pandemic, we have moved the workshops to online, where parents get to access the workshop videos at their own free time.
