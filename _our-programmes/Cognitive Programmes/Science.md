TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH
------------------------------

Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework, our Science curriculum aims to equip our North Springers with the scientific literacy and disposition to inquire and understand themselves and the world around them through:

*   imparting of basic scientific knowledge and concepts;
    
*   equipping scientific process skills via various hands-on inquiry-based learning activities; and
    
*   inculcating positive attitudes like collaboration, responsibility and resilience.
    

Science Experiences
-------------------

Through a myriad of activities, we aim to provide our North Springers with engaging learning experiences to nurture the spirit off inquiry and scientific thinking, helping them relate the roles of Science to their daily life and their environment. Through collaborative learning and guidance provided by our dedicated teachers.
