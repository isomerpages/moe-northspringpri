#### TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH

Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework, our Science curriculum aims to equip our North Springers with the scientific literacy and disposition to inquire and understand themselves and the world around them through:

*   imparting of basic scientific knowledge and concepts;
    
*   equipping scientific process skills via various hands-on inquiry-based learning activities; and
    
*   inculcating positive attitudes like collaboration, responsibility and resilience.
    

#### Science Experiences

Through a myriad of activities, we aim to provide our North Springers with engaging learning experiences to nurture the spirit off inquiry and scientific thinking, helping them relate the roles of Science to their daily life and their environment. Through collaborative learning and guidance provided by our dedicated teachers.

#### Science Activities

Apart from learning about scientific conceptual knowledge, our North Springers are also equipped with procedural skills akin to what real life scientists have through carrying out hands-on experiments, collecting data and making sense of them. Connections of some of these activities are also made to our MakerSpace’s theme on sustainability of resources.

#### Science Play

Learning science is not just about concepts and skills. Applying these concepts and skills learnt to play-based activities further enhance our North Springers’ subject mastery where they could internalise their learnings better while having fun. Talk about Joy of Learning!

#### Science Enrichment Programmes

Selected P4 and P5 North Springers who demonstrated strong passion and potential in the area of Science are involved in our school-based enrichment programmes such as the E2K Science programme as well as the Science Olympiad training.
