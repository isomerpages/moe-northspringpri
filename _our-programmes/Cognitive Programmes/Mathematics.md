#### TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH

North Spring Primary has a dynamic Mathematics curriculum that ignites North Springers’ passion in the subject and nurtures confident and self-directed learners who are active contributors. Guided by MOE’s Mathematics Curriculum Framework, we employ **L**earning **E**xperiences, **A**ctivities and **P**lay (LEAP) to engage all students and develop them to their fullest potential.   

#### Learning Experiences and Activities

We believe that every child wants to and can learn. We focus on children’s learning needs when designing learning experiences and believe that learning flourishes in caring, safe and stimulating learning environments and when children construct knowledge actively. 

We leverage on the environment as the third teacher and fully utilize the many learning spaces in the school, including the garden, our Yummy Cove and ECollaboratory. Classrooms are vibrant and students have opportunities to work in groups and enjoy authentic experiences. As part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme - Maker’s Sustainability Education, Math activities also inspire students to imagine, design, and create projects that align the content of learning with handS-ON learning (SONG).

Students also learn outside of the classroom and engage in LEarning in The Great Outdoors (LET GO). By interacting with physical objects, applying their learning in their daily lives and co-construction of knowledge with their friends, North Springers learn mathematical concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and the right attitude and values.

#### Play

We believe that students learn through games. Games give students the chance to explore basic number concepts, from counting to computation to problem-solving. These would allow students to develop their mathematical understanding and reasoning. Through repeated play, mathematical ideas surface as students see new patterns, relationships and strategies. North Springers’ lessons involve manipulative and active learning. From memory games to bingo to interactive boards, purposeful games complement the curriculum.

#### Support for Learners

Undergirding everything that we are doing in supporting learners is the belief that all students can learn Mathematics given the appropriate instruction and opportunity to learn as we advocate incorporating a variety of approaches and activities. When students believe in themselves that they can learn, they will put in more time and effort in learning, hence leading to better performance and developing a growth mindset in them.

From P1 to P6, students who need additional support out of curriculum time to reinforce concepts taught in class attend our Numeracy Support Programme or Remedial. Both are based on Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) which aims to raise the confidence level of students and improve the overall performance of the low progress students by targeting 4 common learning issues that students face – learning gaps, weak command of the language, low motivation and poor memory retention. ICAN lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

Further, our P1-P2 Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme is designed to provide early intervention in Mathematics to students who need extra support in acquiring basic numeracy skills when they enter Primary One. LSM seeks to level up and help students achieve an age-appropriate mathematical age and equip students with the mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions so that they can learn mathematics with their peers. Students identified for LSM programme are supported by qualified LSM teachers and the class size is kept small so that every student receives individual attention from the LSM teacher.

Mathematics E2K and Enrichment Programmes

The E2K programme is catered to selected Primary 4 to 6 students who demonstrate strong interest and ability in Mathematics. Stories, games and puzzles are often used within the programme to engage the learners in problem solving.

Selected Primary 4 to 6 students also attend Mathematics enrichment workshops held after school. Our P4 students learnt logical reasoning and analytical skills through Mathematics-related magic while our P5 and P6 students had the opportunity to collaborate with their classmates to solve Mathematics Olympiad questions.

#### Mathematics Competitions

We expose our best students to international Math Competitions such as the Singapore Math Kangeroo Contest (SMKC), Singapore And Asian Schools Olympiad (SASMO), National Math Olympiad Singapore (NMOS) and the Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC). Our students do very well in these contests.

The SMKC and SASMO results are announced and summarised below. Students who have done well in these contests are awarded the following:

**Percentile**

Gold Certificate (Top 8% scorers)

Silver Certificate (Next 12%)

Bronze Certificate (Next 20%)
