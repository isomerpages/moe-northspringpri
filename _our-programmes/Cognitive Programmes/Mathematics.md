TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH
------------------------------

North Spring Primary has a dynamic Mathematics curriculum that ignites North Springers’ passion in the subject and nurtures confident and self-directed learners who are active contributors. Guided by MOE’s Mathematics Curriculum Framework, we employ **L**earning **E**xperiences, **A**ctivities and **P**lay (LEAP) to engage all students and develop them to their fullest potential.   

Learning Experiences and Activities
-----------------------------------

We believe that every child wants to and can learn. We focus on children’s learning needs when designing learning experiences and believe that learning flourishes in caring, safe and stimulating learning environments and when children construct knowledge actively. 

We leverage on the environment as the third teacher and fully utilize the many learning spaces in the school, including the garden, our Yummy Cove and ECollaboratory. Classrooms are vibrant and students have opportunities to work in groups and enjoy authentic experiences. As part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme - Maker’s Sustainability Education, Math activities also inspire students to imagine, design, and create projects that align the content of learning with handS-ON learning (SONG).

Students also learn outside of the classroom and engage in LEarning in The Great Outdoors (LET GO). By interacting with physical objects, applying their learning in their daily lives and co-construction of knowledge with their friends, North Springers learn mathematical concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and the right attitude and values.
