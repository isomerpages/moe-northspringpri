The school’s **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**, **Play Your Hearts Out @ North Spring**, strives to provide platforms for enjoyment, cultivate a mindset that fosters excellence and build character and values through the vehicle of physical outdoor activities.

#### LLP Play Experiences

The school’s LLP strives to engage our North Springers’ sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations. The LLP maximises the use of our beginning North Springers’ senses to be comfortable as they explore familiar surroundings. New and unfamiliar locations, in diverse natural and urban environments, provide dynamic situations for mature learners to learn to be safe and make good judgements in a wider range of activities. These exploratory experiences will enable students to develop connections with the environment and the responsibility to safeguard it, thereby facilitating a lifelong pursuit of outdoor physical recreation.

#### LLP Play Activities

**BOULDERING** engages our North Springers for a full body workout with both their upper and lower bodies involved. Bouldering is a full body activity that incorporates every major muscle group and improves flexibility and endurance in our North Springers. It is a great way to develop overall physical fitness through increasing strength and enhancing hand, foot and eye coordination. It also aids in focusing the mind, improves confidence and problem solving towards character building. Bouldering is as much of a mental game as it is a physical feat. When our North Springers challenge their first bouldering wall, they may be overwhelmed by all of the ways they can make it to the top. As they attempt more, they will learn how to mentally map out the most efficient ways to navigate the holds. These problem solving and planning skills can easily transfer to everyday life.

**VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) GAMES** provide a captivating way to travel using technology. With a headset and motion tracking, VR allows our North Springers to navigate virtual spaces as if they are actually there. Our VR games center on computer-generated environment with scenes related to the physical health and fitness knowledge learnt during PE lessons. Through VR, North Springers enhance the understanding of good health practices in nutrition, exercise, safety and hygiene in our North Springers. As North Springers mature, they evaluate their lifestyles and adapt their participation in physical activities at different stages of their lives with understanding of the health benefits derived, and how living active and healthy lives are connected with the world around them and the health of others.

These experiences imbue in our North Springers resilience, ruggedness, tenacity and ability to work well in teams, so that they will be confident to seize future opportunities and tackle challenges together and build a better Singapore as one.
