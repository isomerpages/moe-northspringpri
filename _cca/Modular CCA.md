A key component of studentsâ€™ holistic education, CCAs give students a platform to discover their interests and talents. Through CCAs students develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges. Here at North Spring, we adopt a Modular CCA format. All Primary 3 to 6 students will participate in Modular CCA on Thursday during curriculum time. Every term each level will get to experience a different CCA and at the end of their primary school journey, students will have participated in 16 different CCAs- Basketball, Football, Digital Art, Wire Sculpture, Sand Animation, World Percussion, Beatboxing, Coding, Robotics and Modern Boardgames, just to name a few. These CCAs fall under the categories of Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts and Contemporary Skills.&nbsp; &nbsp;

In Term 1, our North Springer have taken part in Sport-silience (Basketball and Football), Wire Sculpture, Coding and World Percussion.
