<u>SPARK CCA (Striving to Perform At ouR peaK)</u>

While Modular CCA focuses on broad exposure, SPARK CCA is a platform that focuses on striving for excellence. It stretches selected students to perform at a higher level through trainings on Friday afternoons. The school has a selection process that screens all students and suitable ones will be invited to join SPARK CCA. They consist of Basketball, Wushu, International Dance, Show Choir, String Ensemble and Scouts.
