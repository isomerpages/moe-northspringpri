Clubs & Societies
=================

The Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) programme in North Spring Primary School is a key component of studentsâ€™ holistic education. North Springers are given the opportunity discover their interests and talents through a myriad of CCAs. Character, values and social emotional competencies are the main focuses of the programme that prepares each student for future challenges. CCAs also bring students from diverse backgrounds together, promoting cohesion and a sense of belonging to school and community.

There are 4 CCA groups (Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups, Visual and Performing Arts and Clubs and Societies) in our programme and they are represented in the 16 CCAs we offer.
