New Media Club
--------------

In North Spring Primary, our club seeks to prepare our members with the relevant skills needed in this technological world. Our team of teachers and external experts in the various ICT fields deliver a comprehensive learning programme for our club members. There are many useful life skills that they learn which will serve them well in the 21st Century.

Students are introduced to the fundamental concepts of photography, videography and journalism skills in our CCA. Our junior members are introduced to the world of photography and videography and its basic navigation and programming. They learn how to capture and tell a story through the images that they learn to capture. Our senior members are challenged to take on a bigger role by infusing their prior knowledge of photography and videography into action by reporting what they have captured. In time to come our members will get the opportunity to capture moments for school events as well as publish postings on the schoolâ€™s social media platforms.
