Ceramic
=======

Ceramic lessons are designed for students who choose to embrace clay as their creative medium. Our club grant students experiences in making functional as well as sculptural pieces, using a variety of artistic techniques and skills, such as wedge, slab, wheel, coil, pinch and mould.
