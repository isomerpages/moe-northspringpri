Parent Support Group
====================

_“We Care With Unconditional Love”_



**Vision**<br>
Supportive and understanding parents

**Mission**<br>
To provide support for the development of the children within the framework and thrust of the school

**Our Logo**

The letters ‘PSG’ stand for Parent Support Group in North Spring Primary School. Well-fitted together, they form a heart shape to signify the members’<br>
(i) commitment in supporting the school to develop the children and<br>
(ii) selflessness in volunteering their time and effort for the benefit of the children.

#### Involvement Opportunities

PSG members help the school ensure students’ safety at crossing areas near Gates B and F during school reporting and dismissal periods.
