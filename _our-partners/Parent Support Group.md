The letters ‘PSG’ stand for Parent Support Group in North Spring Primary School. Well-fitted together, they form a heart shape to signify the members’<br>
(i) commitment in supporting the school to develop the children and<br>
(ii) selflessness in volunteering their time and effort for the benefit of the children.
